Delayed UI Segmented Control
=============

The Delayed UI Segmented Control is a subclassed UISegmentedControl. It is used
to provide better feedback to the user when the segmented control is touched.
Namely in the case where the segmented control is used in a manner that hides
the control after the touch occurs. The control provides a slight delay before
performing its action so that the user has time to see the touch occur.

History
-------

The Delayed UI Segmented Control originated as a need in [myDomains][2]. On one
of the screens there was an option to add a domain name to one of two lists:
myDomains or myWatches. What was observed was that when clicking the button to
add to the list, the user was too quickly taken to a new view without seeing
the touch take place. Thusly the dealyed control was created.
